    "We chose CIFAR-10 dataset due to its complexity and suitability in evaluating multi-layer neural networks. It holds 60,000 32x32 colour images spanning 10 diverse classes, crescendoing in a challenging classification task surpassing the likes of datasets like MNIST, which only holds grayscale digits. CIFAR-10 includes RGB images, demanding models to learn from more detailed and complex data, mirroring real world applications, where data is diverse and high dimensional. The aforementioned complexity allows rigorous testing of network architectures, activation functions, and techniques to optimise the model. Lastly, it has well documented benchmarks, and  widespread use in academic research making it a top candidate to showcase advanced implementations, setting the ground work for meaningful comparisons and evaluations."
